## Course Overview

* **ML vs. AI vs. Deep Learning** – key differences and connections
* **ML Workflow** – problem definition → data preparation → modeling → evaluation
* **Training & Optimization** – how models learn from data
* **Evaluation** – performance metrics for classification tasks
* **Logistic Regression** – fundamental binary classification model
* **Underfitting, Overfitting & Regularization** – bias-variance tradeoff
* **Hands-on Example** – classification on the **PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset**
