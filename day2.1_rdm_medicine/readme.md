# Research Data Management in Medicine

In this session we cover aspects of research data management (RDM) and open science such as the RDM life cylce, FAIR principles, sharing data on Zenodo, rights and duties of scientists in the RDM context.


As exercise, we will download [Haase_MRT_tfl3d1.tif](Haase_MRT_tfl3d1.tif) share it on Zenodo. We use the [Zenodo sandbox](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/) for practicing this.
