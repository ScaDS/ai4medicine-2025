# Introduction to Deep Learning

In this session we will introduce the fundamental concepts of deep learning with a focus on medical applications. We will discuss the structure of neural networks, the role of convolution and pooling, the idea of loss functions, and how deep learning can capture complex patterns in pathology images. Key challenges such as data variability, annotation effort, and clinical integration will also be addressed to give context to the use of AI in medicine.

In the hands-on part, using a prepared notebook, participants will train a simple image classifier to distinguish different pathology tissue types, tweak their models performance and compete for the a little suprise.
