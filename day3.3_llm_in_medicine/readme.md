# Application of LLMs in Medicine

In the session we will introduce the fundamentals of large language models and explain how they are trained, what they can and cannot do, and why they have become central in current AI research. The talk will also highlight recent studies where LLMs were applied to medical problems such as clinical text summarization, decision support, and information retrieval, with a discussion of both their potential and their limitations in clinical practice.

In the hands-on session ([google colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w6oqwjsuhDTRPgCS9YBfyX5VHc3h1gnE?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iv1ouCqDl2NGkPaFC5tCKmIUxUbaFIlV?usp=sharing)), participants will work through three clinical case vignettes and use LLMs to explore possible diagnoses, interpretations, and management strategies. Each case is structured with beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, so participants can engage by simply formulating clinical questions to an LLM or by attempting deeper, technical tasks such as rephrasing queries and evaluating model responses. Along the way, they will learn how to interact critically with LLM outputs and reflect on opportunities and limitations of AI in clinical decision support.
