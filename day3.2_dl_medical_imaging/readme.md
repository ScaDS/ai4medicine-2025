# Application of Deep Learning in Medical Imaging (Radiology)

You can download the slides from the theory part [here](3.2_dl_medical_imaging.pdf).

In the hands-on session, you will train a deep learning model predicting abnormalities from chest X-rays. 
In this session, we will use HPC system and services provided at TU Dresden/ZIH. The same virtual environment as in the previous session "DL Introduction" will be used.
